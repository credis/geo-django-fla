About
*****

Django application to simplify management of GEOFLA(R) datas of the IGN (french
geographic institute).
No GEOFLA(R) datas are provided.
You have to get them on the IGN website. Theses datas are distributed under an
open licence (Licence Ouverte 1.0).

Why not using a "simple" shp2pg?
 - upgrade is managed
 - tables are automatically linked between them with foreign key
 - "chef lieu" and "centroid" are converted to points
 - and all the benefit of having a ready to serve django application.
